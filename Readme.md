# Documentation for object detection from drone command

The goal of this project is to develop a computer vision application that detects keymarkers to enable a drone follow a flight plane.

The Project worked well so far but I was only able to reach 4 out of 5 objectives which are:

- Detect Arrow shape and color
- Detect Squre shape and color
- Detect Triangle shape and color 
- Detect cross shape and color 

The last objective which is the key objective is to output the direction the arrow is pointing, but sadly I couldn't implement this.

I am uploading this to help anyone who has similar project and doesn't know where to start from (I has similar issues).

Goodluck in your project!
